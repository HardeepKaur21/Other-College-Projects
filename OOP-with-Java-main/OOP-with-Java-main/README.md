# OOP-with-Java
2 of my best written code involving object oriented programming

There are mainly 3 projects in this repository.

<ins>Wordle:</ins> the viral game from last year was simulated using java and data sctructures alone.

<ins>Wordle Helper:</ins> this code is supposed to help a player playing wordle by suggesting potential words that can be the answer

<ins>Vending machine:</ins> this code in particular helped me undetstand how object oriented programming works. This is a code I wrote ouside of university curriculum to help me understand how real life objects and be broken down to methods and classes.
